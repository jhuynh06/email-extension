   - Verify API key is entered correctly
   - Test API connection

2. **AI Button Not Appearing**:
   - **For Gmail**: Refresh the page, button should appear in compose toolbar

     - Standard toolbar placement
     - Near Send button  
     - Custom toolbar creation
     - Emergency orange pulsing button
     - Floating button (top-right corner)

   - Check API key validity (test with "Test API Connection" button)
   - Verify internet connection
   - Check if you've exceeded API quota
   - If you get 404 "model not found" errors, the API may be using newer model names

4. **Generated Response Not Inserting**:
   - Try clicking in the compose area first
   - Refresh the page and try again
   - Check browser console for JavaScript errors

#### Debug Mode

1. **Enable Console Logging**:
   ```javascript
   // Open browser console (F12) on Gmail/Outlook page
   // Check for extension-related messages
   ```

2. **Check Extension Background**:
   ```bash
   # Go to chrome://extensions/

   # Check for error messages
   ```
